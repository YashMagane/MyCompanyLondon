# 🎨 Figma to HTML & CSS Conversion

This project builds on the fundamentals of HTML by introducing **CSS styling** to accurately recreate a website from a **Figma design**.  
The goal was to match the provided design layouts **pixel-for-pixel**, ensuring responsiveness, structure, and clean code organization.

## 🧩 Project Overview

After mastering HTML semantics in earlier exercises, this project focused on combining **HTML and CSS** to visually bring a design to life.  

Using a multi-page Figma design as a reference, I built a complete static website that includes:
- **Home Page**
- **Services Page**
- **Contact Page**

## 🖌️ Key Objectives

- Translate a Figma prototype into a fully functional website using HTML and CSS.  
- Maintain a **clean, semantic structure** while ensuring **design fidelity**.  
- Strengthen understanding of **layout techniques** such as **Flexbox** and **Grid**.  
- Implement consistent styling, spacing, and typography across all pages.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structure and semantics  
- **CSS** – for layout, design, and responsiveness

## 🎨 Design Details

Each page was styled to mirror the provided Figma design:
- Consistent color palette and typography  
- Spacing and alignment based on design guidelines  
- Proper use of containers and reusable classes

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Enhanced ability to convert Figma designs into clean, working code.  
- Improved understanding of **CSS specificity**, **selectors**, and **layout control**.  
- Developed a strong grasp of **responsive design principles**.  
- Learned how to maintain consistent design systems across multiple pages.
